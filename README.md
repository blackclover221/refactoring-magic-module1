# Week 1 Challenge 

# refactoring-magic-module1

Code Refactoring project for accessbility per client request. During the first week of my bootcamp journey, I have learned the importance of accessibility when making a website. 

Some of the challenges faced when doing this project was the background colour blending into one, instead of having two different colours as the client wanted. Initially, I thought this was a style.css issue so I kept backtracking my steps to ensure I have not made any mistakes. After a short break which consisted of me crying to my husband about how I cannot seem to find the mistake. I revisted the index.html changes I made and realised I did not close the header bracket. I learned that something so small can have a huge impact on the appearance of the website.
